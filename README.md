## Responsive-Forms
Specification
A Collection of responsive form designs using pure HTML and CSS without any framework. 

# Installation
To install, CLI not required. Simply download to your computer, open any of the folder included and run the "index.html" file found.

Coding Stage
The repo contains one form design at the moment ðŸ˜Š. However, I intend to add several other designs later in the future.

Approach
The survey form is responsive but I didn't use mobile first approach. Subsequntly, other designs would follow the mobile first approach.
